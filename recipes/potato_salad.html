    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes<br>It's not potato salad without potatoes. The recipe doesn't specify what size potatoes or what kind, so choose medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. As far as what kind of potatoes to use for potato salad, I'll cover that in the next section.</li>
        <li>Eggs<br>Hard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to.</li>
        <li>Celery<br>Celery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Onion<br>You can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion.</li>
        <li>Relish<br>Use your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet.</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise<br>This is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion. </li>
        <li>Mustard<br>Use your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon.</li>
        <li>Seasonings<br>This recipe calls for garlic salt, celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder. You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
